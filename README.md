// Final Project -->Blog site

// For my final project, I intend to create a blogging site with login, 

// a display showing current date and time, as well as a time stamp for

// each blog entry.  The blog entries themselves will have a text input 

// input box and then option for an added image.  The image will have an 

// an active link that when the image is clicked, will take you to a map

// where it will display the precise location of where the photo was 

// taken.
